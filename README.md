Agent Bases Modelling eth civil violence 

Structure:
Three different implementations exist.
Implementation 1 has some alternative implementations:
- an extension for global access to information (media)
- a corrected version for the floor() (legitimacy fluctuations)

How to run simulations from implementation 1:
warning: you need to have the basic python libraries installed  (e.g. numpy)
the code was designed for python 3
- download the three files (main.py, main.ui, toolbox.py) in the same folder
- open the terminal there
- type "python main.py" 
- a graphic interface will appear. Press the "start" button
- if you want you can change the parameters with the slider

Graphic interface:
- left: 2D representation of the spatial grid. 
green: inactive agent
red: active agent
blue: cop
white: empty
- right: graph of jailed agents (green) and active agents (red) as a function of time steps.
