Structure:
Three different implementations exist.
Implementation 1 has some alternative implementations:
- an extension for global access to information (media)
- a corrected version for the floor() (legitimacy fluctuations)

How to run simulations from implementation 1:
- download the three files (main.py, main.ui, toolbox.py) in the same folder.
- open the terminal there
- type "python main.py"
- a graphic interface will appear. Press the "start" button
- if you want you can change the parameters with the slider
